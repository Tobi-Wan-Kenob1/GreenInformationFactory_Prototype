## üì° Notes on Zenodo Integration

The notebook will download raw data directly from Zenodo using this DOI:

- **DOI**: [10.5281/zenodo.16256961](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16256961)

Make sure you are connected to the internet to fetch the file.

---

## üì¶ Optional: Upload Preprocessed Data to Zenodo

To upload cleaned datasets or models back to Zenodo, we recommend doing this **manually via Zenodo.org**, or using the [Zenodo REST API](https://developers.zenodo.org/), which can be integrated later.
